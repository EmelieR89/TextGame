            <h4>You wake up. Your head is pounding and you're nauseous. You put your hand on your forehead, blood.
                Everything is a blur. What happened yesterday? You and your best friend where out hiking, and the last
                thing you remeber was a blow to the head. What is this place? You stand up and look around. Your phone
                is not in your pocket, just the compass that your friend gave you before the hike.
                Oh my god, where is he? Nobody’s there. “Hello?” No answer, dead silence. Then, in the distance, heavy
                footsteps. The panic kicks in. You need to get out… </h4>
