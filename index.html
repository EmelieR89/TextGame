        <h4>You wake up. Your head is pounding and you're nauseous. You put your hand on your forehead, blood.
            Everything is a blur. What happened yesterday? You and your best friend where out hiking, and the last
            thing you remeber was a blow to the head. What is this place? You stand up and look around. Your phone is
            not in your pocket, just the compass that your friend gave you before the hike.
            Oh my god, where is he?
            Nobody’s there. “Hello?” No answer, dead silence. Then, in the distance, heavy footsteps. The panic
            kicks in. You need to get out… </h4>
